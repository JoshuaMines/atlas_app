Atlas App was created as a way for olympic lifters to track their progress on the way to the 1000lb club.  
Each lift (bench, squat, deadlift) is compared to a target value that adds up to 1000lb, this lets the lifter know
how close they are to entering the 1000lb club.

This app took me about 12 hours to create.  The additional info (squat, dead, bench) took another 2 hours to create.

Things I want to add:
-The ability to track a users lifts so they can see a graph outlining their progress
-Change target goals so users can customize it to a specific weight
-Additional info on working out and workout plans
